OrbitControls (2axis rotation and zooming) are nice and intuitive, especially when the navigation should be compatible with the touchpad.

FirstPerson (3axis movement, 2axis view movement, zooming) controls are more intuituve at a keyboard.



RENDERING:
 - How to render animated streamlines? Can it be done for data of my size?



AIMING ISSUES:
 - a crosshair overlay does not show depth, but spheres can be added at predefined depth - could be difficult if the spheres are added onhte other side of objects though.
 - scales: maybe there is some relationship between the depth and size of the annotation sphere?
 
 
 - first add the aiming aid to the scene
 - use raytracing to find candidate depth
 - if no candidate depth position at fixed depth
 - use sliders to adjust
 - modes need to exist to add/edit/remove spheres.
 
 
 
 DECALS:
 - first edit image in paint to create texture
 - then load and apply decal
 - finally work on interactively creating decal
 
 
 
 
 
TODO:
 - generic coordinate system indicator
