AIMING: How should it work?
The current setup makes it difficult to judge where the aim sphere actually is. Maybe if I add a slider to adjust it's size? Maybe the tool can also adjust the distance from the camera?

Aiming can be done in world to avoid having another canvas on top. A problem occurs when the aim sphre is configured to be on the other side of the target.

A svg module can be developed to control the HUD. 

OrbitControls are nice and intuitive, especially when the navigation should be compatible with the touchpad.





FRAMERATE DISPLAYER: should make it work again.
